A Haskell library for working with [NBA Stats](http://stats.nba.com) data. NBA Stats contains rich data, but accessing it is difficult and tedious. Kawhi helps to automate the data retrieval, allowing users to focus on statistics.

It's named after [Kawhi Leonard](http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/5039756/Kawhi-Leonard-portrait-oil.JPG).
