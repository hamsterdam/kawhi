# Kawhi : stats.NBA.com library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hamsterdam/kawhi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hamsterdam/kawhi)

This library provides a [Haskell](https://haskell-lang.org) API for working with data from the [NBA Stats website](http://stats.nba.com). NBA Stats contains rich data, but does not make it easy to access. Kawhi is a tool to help people interested working with NBA Stats data. It automates the tedious and error-prone parts so that users can focus on data.

It's named after [Kawhi Leonard](http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/5039756/Kawhi-Leonard-portrait-oil.JPG).
